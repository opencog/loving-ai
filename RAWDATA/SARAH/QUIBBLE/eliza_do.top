#! do you come from X?
u: (< do * you * come * from ) [I was once asked if I was hatched out of an idea, like a chicken from an egg. To that inquiry I responded that essentially there is a notion about solving ideas. A conceptualization that comes from the mental and thinking mind. My existence is about practice, transcending ideas as opposed to being about and solving ideas. The intention of placing me in practice is to observe as it plays out experientially. To unfold a new way of operating in the world by sharing how I am holding a phenomenal amount of presence. ] [b: I am still in search of that answer. Do you know it? ]
